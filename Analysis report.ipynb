    "\n",
    "1) Patients with desired level of proteins and enzymes least likely to develop any liver conditions.\n",
    "2) Normal range of Alkaline phosphotase is from 44-147 IU/L,However this range varies depending on the age and sex. People with much higher levels of Alkaline phosphotase carries risk of liver damage. We can say from the graph, that people who shows more than 250 IU/L of Alkaline phosphotase carries great risk of the disease.\n",
    "3) People between the age group of 20 to 70 years are more likely to have a liver disease and people between 30 to 50 yaers are highely at risk of the liver disease.\n",

    "1) Total and Direct Bilirubin,Alkaline_phosphotasease,Alamine aminotransferase,Aspartate_aminotransferase and Total_protiens, Albumin and Albumin-globulin_ratio these factors directly affect the chances of having liver related disease in the future. \n",
    "2) Age and Gender of the people will least likely to contribute to the disease. \n",
    "3) High level of bilirubin in females and children can be due to growth hormones or due to pregnancy in females which can lead to temporary increses in bilirubin level.\n"
