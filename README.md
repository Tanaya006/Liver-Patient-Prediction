# Liver-Patient-Prediction
Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

 **Aim** - The main objective of this is to build different predictive models to determine the presence of liver disease and evaluate their performance.
This project outlines the analysis of different machine learning algorithms used to predict the liver disease patients.

You can find the detailed Analysis report of the project below in the files section.
